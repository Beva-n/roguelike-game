# The Dungeon
## General Description
The proposed project for this term is the design and development of a **roguelike video game**
that integrates captivating boss fights. Titled *The Dungeon*, the game will be meticulously
designed to not only appeal to enthusiasts of the roguelike genre, but also attract and welcome
those unacquainted with this game style. The interest in undertaking this project is rooted in my
profound admiration for the genre's unique blend of **high replayability**, **procedural generation**,
and **deep player engagement**. I am particularly fascinated by how roguelike games such as
*Hades* , *The Binding of Isaac* and *Realm of the Mad God* have elevated boss fights into
memorable and intricate challenges that players anticipate and strategize for, rather than mere
roadblocks. Through *The Dungeon*, I hope to explore these intriguing facets further and
contribute to the ongoing evolution of the roguelike genre.

## Key Features
- Procedurally Generated Dungeons: Every run presents a new, uncharted path to navigate
- Engaging Boss Fights: Bosses will offer unique challenges and require tactical prowess to defeat
- Customizable Character Builds: Players will have the freedom to mold their characters
  based on their preferred playstyle.
